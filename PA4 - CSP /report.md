# CS76: AI - 21F - PA4 - CSP Map/Circuitboard Solver - Julian Grunauer - 10/19/21

## Results

### Description

## Evaluation

## Discussion Questions

* (map coloring test) Describe the results from the test of your solver with and without heuristic, and with and without inference on the map coloring problem.

* (circuit-board) In your write-up, describe the domain of a variable corresponding to a component of width w and height h, on a circuit board of width n and height m.  Make sure the component fits completely on the board.

* (circuit-board) Consider components a and b above, on a 10x3 board.  In your write-up, write the constraint that enforces the fact that the two components may not overlap.  Write out legal pairs of locations explicitly.

* (circuit-board) Describe how your code converts constraints, etc, to integer values for use by the generic CSP solver.
